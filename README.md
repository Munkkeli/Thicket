## Story

### Prologue
You are playing as young Brian Jr. Brian is a 12-year-old fifth grader boy. The day is cloudy and Brian’s school day has just come to an end when he suddenly gets a text message from his mother. “Brian love, I’m making cinnamon rolls come home quick before they get cold!”. Brian loving his mother's cinnamon rolls decides to take a shortcut to get home as quick as possible. The road that he normally takes goes around a thick forest that Brian has never gone through before. The forest looks dark and spooky, but Brian’s love for cinnamon rolls takes over, and he decides to go through anyway.

### Characters
Our game features one playable character, Brian Jr. The other character that is only mentioned but never shown is Brian’s mother.

### Animals
The game features one type of animal, an eagle and it’s chicks. The chicks never leave the nest, but the eagle is aggressive and tries to attack you if you get too close. They also serve as a puzzle mechanic where you need to feed them food so the eagle lets you pass.

### Game world
The playable area of the game is all contained in the forest that you are trying to go through. It’s split into 3 areas, Forest, Swamp and the Thicket. The game progresses through the areas in the given order, and once you complete an area you can’t go back.
The first area begins where Brian enters the forest, and the last area ends where Brian leaves the forest. The world features a top down perspective, this makes it easy for us to develop and design the world using premade tilesets.

### Graphics
Graphics are made of pixelated 16x16, 32-bit sprites. The world will also feature some more modern graphical elements, like an animated UI and environmental effects like fog and clouds. Some tiles are also animated, like water.

### Beating the game
The game has two endings, one where you make it home in time and the other where the cinnamon rolls get cold. You can’t really “lose” the game, the other ending is just there to reward players who beat the game fast enough.

### Extra objectives
The game features collectible items in hidden areas that experienced players can try to collect. The collectibles also boost the replayability of the game, changing the experience from just making it to the end to collecting everything on the way.
